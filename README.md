# Deep Trance
Deep Trance or: Exploring the Mysteries of the Universe, While Trying Not to Disappoint Your Martian Guru and/or Yoga Teacher By Getting Too Stressed Out From Being Distracted From Pointless Minigames (I Mean Seriously, Why Did These Stupid Minigames Get Made?)

[Made for Ludum Dare 48.](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/48/deep-trance)

Not really a finished game compared to the actual idea it was supposed to be, but I suppose it's kinda playable (not that the actual fully realized product would have been intended to be very playable anyways).
